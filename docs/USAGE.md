# Usage

Use the PHP web UI to submit jobs and view results generated by the Python
runner scripts.

## Quick start
```bash
mkdir -p output
```

```bash
podman compose up --build
```

Open http://localhost:8080/php/volumeCalc.php in a browser, submit a job, and
wait for the results page to populate.

## Examples
```bash
podman compose logs -f web
```

Submit a volume calculation from the volume calculator page and monitor progress
on the results page.

```bash
ls output
```

Inspect job folders under [output/](output/) to find generated artifacts.

## Inputs and outputs
- Inputs come from the web form fields in [php/](php/) pages.
- Outputs are written under [output/](output/), including
  `results-<jobid>.html`, `runlog-<jobid>.html`, and `shell-<jobid>.log`.
- Results pages are served by [php/viewResults.php](php/viewResults.php) when a
  `jobid` is provided.

## Known gaps
- TODO: Document per-tool input formats and parameters for each PHP entry point.
- TODO: Confirm whether direct CLI usage of `run*.py` is supported and document it if so.

See [docs/CONTAINER.md](docs/CONTAINER.md) for the full list of entry points and
runtime details.
